      "speaker": "Team Member 2",
      "en": "I agree! I've been feeling a bit disconnected from the team recently. We're all so busy with our individual projects that we don't get much time to just talk and get to know each other better."

      "speaker": "Team Member 3",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Team Member 3",
      "en": "I think we could establish more regular check-ins, maybe weekly team meetings where we all share what we're working on and any challenges we're facing. This would help everyone stay informed."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Team Member 4",
      "en": "Great idea! I'd also suggest creating a shared project dashboard where we can all see what everyone is working on and how projects are progressing. This would improve transparency."
    },
    {
      "speaker": "Team Member 1",

    },
    {
      "speaker": "Team Member 4",
      "en": "I'd like us to increase our knowledge sharing. Maybe we could start a weekly knowledge sharing session where each person presents something they've learned or a project they've completed."
